- Node
- Express
- EJS
- Bootstrap

yarn install
```

## Developing
### Live Reloading

If you'd like, you can make use of live-reloading. In order to use this, you just need to make sure to have gulp-cli installed globally.
```
npm i -g gulp-cli
```

You can then just use the following command to run the application with live-reloading:
```
gulp
```

### Without Live Reloading
If you don't want to install gulp-cli, you can use one of the following commands to run the appllication without live-reloading:

```
npm start
```
or
```
yarn start
```
